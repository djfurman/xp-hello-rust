# Hello Rust

This project is the base getting started project in the [official rust documentation](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) and my first foray into the Rust programming language.

## Running the program

1. Ensure rust dependencies are all installed
1. Run `cargo run` to see the rust mascot say hello

## Running individual parts

1. Run `rustc src/hello.rs`
1. Run `./hello` as the compiled binary
